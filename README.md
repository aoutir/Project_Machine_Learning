# Extract roads from satellite images

Given a set of satellite/aerial images acquired from GoogleMaps and ground-truth images where each pixel is labeled as {road, background}. The goal of the project is to train a classifier to segment roads in these images, i.e. assign a label {road=1, background=0} to each pixel. 

# Build instructions

To run the code you need to download on the root of the project our models from the above link:

Specifically the models: unet-depth 3, unet-depth 4, unet-depth 5, DeepLabV3Resnet-101, DeeplabV3MobileNetV3-Large and LR-ASPPMobileNetV3-Large are to be downloaded.
